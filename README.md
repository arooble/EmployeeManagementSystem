# EmployeeManagementSystem
This Java-based project I built on the console is a system that empowers users to handle employee data effectively by adding, updating, or deleting records, displaying employee details, and calculating salaries. Employing object-oriented programming, I designed classes like "Employee" to organize and store employee information. The console interface offers user-friendly interactions, making it convenient to operate the system. To maintain data accuracy, I implemented data integrity measures and incorporated error handling for invalid inputs. This project streamlines administrative tasks, bringing ease and efficiency to HR personnel or managers in managing employee records.
